This directory contains build scripts for doing a full build on various machine.

Linux:

Native, trying:
$ make -f makefile.sdl mdark
in the root of the repository and fix any missing libraries.

Compiling for Windows on Linux:

Install mingw:
sudo apt-get install gcc-mingw-w64-x86-64 g++-mingw-w64-x86-64 wine64

Now get the development libraries (you need the headers).
Unzip and copy include over:
# mkdir /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-w64-mingw32/8.3-win32/include/SDL2
# cp -r include/* /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-w64-mingw32/8.3-win32/include/SDL2

Now do the same for lua5.3:

Download the lua binaries for window, as of writing it was: lua-5.3.6_Win64_dllw6_lib.zip
# mkdir /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-w64-mingw32/8.3-win32/include/lua5.3/
# cp -r include/* /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-w64-mingw32/8.3-win32/include/lua5.3/

Now download libsndfile and copy over header:
# cp libsndfile-1.0.31-win64/include/sndfile.h /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-w64-mingw32/8.3-win32/include/

Now copy over the SDL_ttf header as well
# cp SDL2_ttf-2.0.15/x86_64-w64-mingw32/include/SDL2/SDL_ttf.h /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-w64-mingw32/8.3-win32/include/SDL2

Now for the .dlls you may either copy them over to system, or create a lib directory. I prefer the lib directory as that allows me to switch them out if I need to play with different versions.

In repos/soloscuro:
$ mkdir libs/
$ cp <path-to-sdl2>/x86_64-w64-mingw32/lib/SDL2.dll libs/
$ cp <path-to-sdl2>/x86_64-w64-mingw32/lib/libSDL2main.a libs/
$ cp <path-to-sdl2_ttf>x86_64-w64-mingw32/bin/SDL2_ttf.dll libs/
$ cp <path-to-lua5.3>/lua53.dll libs/
$ cp <path-to-sndfile>libsndfile-1.0.31-win64/bin/sndfile.dll libs/
$ cp <path-to-ADLMIDI>/ADLMIDI.dll libs/

Note: You either copy ADLMIDI.dll from the soloscuro dev pack to libs, or build it yourself.

Windows:
