There are some very strange issues with how the engine and gff works. This is just some design decisions to can keep
things straight.

1) mapx and mapy are going to be the actual block so we can keep track of what block an item is in.
2) The screen location will be map? * 16 - ?offset (? is x or y.) The offset is usually in the etab. For cloned objects it will
need to be calculated.
3) Because of the GPL, coordinates in the GPL (and lua) will be mapx/mapy location. These are hardcoded in many
instances, therefore getX/getY needs to return mapx/mapy!
4) The above should render bmpx/bmpy obsolete, so eventually get rid of it.
