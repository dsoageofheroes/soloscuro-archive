# Operation level of players

Ok 0- no powers but it was used to tag players that were active in RP events.
It allowed them to get special tattoos and access some special areas. Oh and take screenshots.
1 - Change your own name, and current avatar. Used if someone was RPing in an event
2- All of the above, could teleport to anywhere on the map. And set special variables to your own character. For example the only way to be a High Templar was to set the flag on yourself using an admin menu(really the convo menu when you selected yourself)
3- All of the above but you can do these things to players, change names set tattoos, teleport, etc..
I almost forgot 2-3 had a no clip option
If 2-3 wanted to generate items they needed to go to the Rampant Drake and no clip over to the item area and just pick one up off the gorund
4 could set the passcodes to the guild halls, directly access player inventories and change event flags. This would be  a GM level

  thanks, that is helpful. So were there 5 levels (0 through 4) of admins. Do you recall how these were granted? I'm assuming 2+ came from higher level admins. It looks like 1 could have been bestowed by some event/quest.

Also, tattoos? Was there a shop to get these? How did they affect/appear on your character?

I think a 4 could bestow Sysop 1-4, and a 1 a 0
There are allot of objects in the world that acted as a debug item of sorts that responded to sysop levels too
I forget which ones did what

Tattoo just appeared in the character description when you use the look icon on them
